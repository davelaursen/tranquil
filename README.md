# Tranquil

## Overview
Tranquil is a Golang package that wraps the core testing package with BDD-style constructs. These
constructs are based on the Mocha/Chai JavaScript BDD libraries.

The code for this project is based on the [Mao](https://github.com/azer/mao) project, which was abandoned
and the author does not recommend using. It is also similar to the [Zen](https://github.com/pranavraja/zen)
project, which is also based on Mao but implements different assertions.

## Installation

Make sure you have a working Go environment. [See the installation instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install.html).

To install (or update) Tranquil, simply run:

```
$ go get -u github.com/davelaursen/tranquil
```

## Examples
